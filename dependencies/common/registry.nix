# HIAHKernel Dependency Registry
# Each entry defines a dependency that can be built for iOS
{
  # Dependencies will be added here as needed
  # Example format:
  # dependency-name = {
  #   owner = "github-owner";
  #   repo = "repo-name";
  #   rev = "commit-or-tag";
  #   sha256 = "sha256-hash";
  #   platforms = [ "ios" ];
  #   buildSystem = "cmake"; # or "meson", "autotools", "xcode"
  #   description = "Description of the dependency";
  # };
}
